# Welcome to JobThinker

Jobthinker is a simple interactive journal designed for career ideation and planning. A user can formalize a plan for a given career and later leave a progress entry on how things are going. A user can also list their commitments, which are intentionally juxtaposed with career plans so as to highlight discrepencies between goals and actual commitments.

This gem was developed as a rails project for Flatiron school.
